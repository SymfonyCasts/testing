# Dino Health

!!!!!!! Start with screen on the app !!!!!!!!! <----- Note to self while recording, to be removed before merge...

Bob has just told us he needs to display which dinos are accepting lunch in our
app... Ha... I mean visitors. GenLab has strict protocols in place for our dinos - 
park guests can visit with healthy dinos but if they're sick, no visitors allowed...
To help display this, we need to store the health status for each of our dinos and
have an easy way to figure out whether or not this means they're accepting visitors...

## Are they accepting visitors?

Lets start by adding a method - `isAcceptingVisitors()` to our `Dinosaur`. But,
we'll do this the TDD way by writing the test first. In `DinosaurTest` add
`public function testIsAcceptingVisitorsByDefault()`. I say by default because if 
we simply instantiate a `Dinosaur` and do nothing else the dino *should* be accepting
visitors. Inside, `$dino = new Dinosaur()` and let's call him `Dennis` and 
`assertTrue()` that Dennis `isAcceptingVisitors()`

Below this test, add `public function testIsNotAcceptingVisitorsIfSick()`. Inside
this one call `$this->markTestImcomplete()`.

Move to our terminal to run our test:

```terminal
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox
```

And... great! Our `isAcceptingVisitors()` test is failing because of a

> Call to undefined method.

But our *next* test has this weird circle `âˆ…` because we marked the test as incomplete.
I use this sometimes when I know I'll need a test for a feature, but I'm not ready to 
*completely* write the test yet. There also is a `markSkipped()` method that can 
be used too when you need to skip tests under certain conditions. For instance, 
if the test only should run on PHP 8.1.

Anywho, lets get back to coding shall we... In our `Dinosaur` class, add
`public function isAcceptingVisitors()` that returns `bool`. Inside, return `true`.

In the terminal run our tests again...

```terminal-silent
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox

```

And... Yes! `Is accepting visitors by default`... is now passing! Check it out,
even though we still have are "sick" test marked as incomplete, *all* of our tests
are passing. This is super cool when using a continuous integration service, like 
GitHub Actions, where we wouldn't want a skipped or incomplete test to crash our CI.

## Sick Dino's - Stay Away!

Alrighty, time to take care of this incomplete test... a quick peek at the issues
on GitHub - GenLab is using labels for "Sick" and "Healthy" dino's. We can probably
use those labels too on our dino objects.

Inside our test, remove `markAsIncomplete()` and create a `$dino` with the name
`Bumpy`. Now call `$dino->setHealth('Sick')` and then `assertFalse()` that
Bumpy `isAcceptingVisitors()`. Hmm... PHPStorm is telling us

> Method setHealth() is not found inside Dinosaur

so let's skip running the test and in `Dinosaur` add a new `setHealth()` method that 
accepts a `string $health` argument and returns `void`. Inside, set the `$health`
on `$this->health` then up top, add a `private string $health` property that defaults
to `'Health'`.

Cool! The last thing we need to do is change the return value in `isAcceptingVisitors()`.
Instead of `true`, return `$this->health === $healthy`.

Fingers crossed are tests are now passing...

```terminal-silent
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox
```

And... Mission Accomplished!

# Enums are cool for health labels

But I'm thinking that we should refactor our `setHealth()` to only allow `Sick` or 
`Healthy` and not something like `Dancing`... Create a new `Enum/` folder
inside the `src` directory then create a new class - `HealthStatus`. For the 
template, select `Enum` and click `OK`. We need `HealthStatus` to be backed by a
`: string`... and our first `case HEALTHY` will return `Healthy` then `case SICK`
will return `Sick`.

On the `Dinosaur::health` property default to `HealthStatus::HEALTHY`. And down 
in our `isAcceptingVisitors()` method, return true if 
`$this->health === HealthStatus::HEALTHY`.

Last thing todo is use `HealthStatus::SICK` in our test. Now we can run our tests
again...

```terminal-silent
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox
```

And... Ya! We didn't break anything...

## Show which exhibits are open

Alrighty... To fulfill Bob's wishes, Open our `index.html.twig` template here 
in the `main/` templates directory and add a `Accepting Visitors`
heading to our table. In the dino loop, call `dino.acceptingVisitors` and we'll
show `Yes` if this is true or `No` if we get false.

In the browser, refresh the status page... And... WooHoo! All
of our dinos are accepting visitors!

But... We already know from looking at GitHub earlier, that some of our dinos 
*are* sick and per GenLab's protocols they should *not* be accepting visitors... 
We *could* set `HealthStatus::SICK` for our sick dinos in the `MainController`. But,
why not just get the health labels from GitHub instead. We'll do that next by 
creating a GitHub Service to keep our dino table updated automatically.
